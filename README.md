# Typing-web
Fun clone inspired by Edclub and MonkeyType! I created this project out of curiosity to understand how typing tests work while improving my own skills.
## Features
- Custom Themes: Choose from multiple unique themes, such as  Simpsons,  Ghibli, and more. Each theme comes with its own background, colors, and set of typing texts, like quotes and information.
- Smooth Animations: Enjoy smooth visual feedback while typing. The cursor briefly turns red upon mistakes, and error indications have a subtle glowing and fading effect.
- Loading Experience: The project includes a custom JavaScript loading indicator. Background images load fully before being displayed, ensuring a seamless experience.
- Unique Design Elements: Vibrant and engaging color schemes, as well as animations, are used to make the typing experience enjoyable.
## Technologies Used
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
## How It Works
- Typing Test: Start typing to match the displayed text. Mistakes are highlighted, and you can track your speed and accuracy in real time.
- Theme Switching: Switch between themes easily. Each theme loads with unique text content and visual design, making every experience fresh.
