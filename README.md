# Typing-web

Fun clone inspired by Edclub and MonkeyType! I created this project out of curiosity to understand how typing tests work while improving my own skills. 

This skill also marks a milestone very close to my heart because I decided to learn touch typing at a very early stage in college (even before I started) to be one of the skills that would make me stand out among developers. After 3 years of continuous learning, I proved to myself that small steps can lead to achieving big goals — it's not always about making giant leaps.

## Features

- **Custom Themes**: Choose from multiple unique themes such as *Simpsons*, *Ghibli*, and more. Each theme brings its own background, color palette, and themed typing content like quotes and fun facts.
- **Live Speed Calculation**: Your typing speed is calculated in real-time, based on characters typed and time passed. It's a great example of how programmers continuously track and calculate performance metrics live while interacting with user input.
- **Leaderboard**: A built-in leaderboard system records and displays the top performances, adding a competitive edge and motivation to improve.
- **Theme Deletion**: Users can delete themes they no longer want, keeping the experience clean and personalized.
- **Smooth Animations**: Enjoy responsive visual feedback while typing. Mistakes trigger a glowing red cursor and gentle fade effects for clarity and flow.
- **Unique Design Elements**: Carefully chosen colors, transitions, and animations make the typing experience both exciting and aesthetic.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Backend**: PHP, MySQL

## How It Works

- **Typing Test**: Users type to match on-screen content. Mistakes are highlighted in real time, and stats such as speed and accuracy are tracked live.
- **Theme Switching**: Easily switch between themed modes, each featuring its own distinct visuals and typing content to keep things fresh and engaging.
- **Speed Logic**: The speed is dynamically updated based on elapsed time and number of characters typed, ensuring accurate real-time feedback.

## About the Project

This was my **first full-stack web application**, fully designed and implemented by me.  
It was a fun and rewarding learning experience — from handling frontend animations and user interactions to managing backend logic and storing results with PHP and MySQL.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This project requires a backend database to run properly. It is not ready for plug-and-play usage without setting up the server and database environment.
